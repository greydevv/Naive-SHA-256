# SHA-256

A basic Python implementation of the *256-bit Secure Hash Algorithm*, more commonly known as `SHA-256`. Not only was this project meant for research on hashing algorithms, but also for research and practice in manipulating bits in binary sequences. There are no uses of builtins such as `bin`, `ord`, `hex`, or any others that assist in converting between strings, integers, and binary representations.

It should be made known that this implementation is *not* meant for use in cryptographically secure programs - it is simply the most basic implementation of SHA-256 written purely in python.
